Rice, is one of the world's most extensively grown and consumed cereal crops and is also one of country's most important forms of nourishment as it has high nutritional value and low cost. Rice goes through a cleansing procedure, colour sorting, and categorization on its way from the farm to our table. There are two major varieties of rice- **Osmancik**, and **Cammeo**. In order to distinguish between the two rice species, in this research, a modernized vision framework was created to recognize these two rice species.
